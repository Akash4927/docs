Setting Up OpenEBS - Overview
-----------------------------

OpenEBS can run on various platforms: from your laptop, to VMs on a
cloud provider. OpenEBS is also aimed at providing the option of using
hybrid deployments where data is distributed between cloud and
on-premise environments.

If you are beginner to Kubernetes and OpenEBS, OpenEBS recommends you to
get started by setting up Kubernetes. The Kubernetes documentation
provides you various Kubernetes installation options to choose from. See
[Setup.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

If you are already an experienced Kubernetes user and if you have
Kubernetes installed you can deploy OpenEBS through either of the
following:

-   kubectl - you can easily setup OpenEBS on your existing Kubernetes
    cluster with a few simple kubectl commands. See, quick-start.
-   helm

The following flowchart helps you visualize how you can get started with
OpenEBS.

We are looking for help from the community in including additional
platforms where OpenEBS has been successfully deployed. Please share
your story through GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues) or [Pull
requests](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/pulls).
